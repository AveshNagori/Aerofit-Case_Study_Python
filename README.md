Project Overview: Aerofit Consumer Behavior Analysis
This case study delves into Aerofit, examining a dataset comprising 9 columns: Product, Age, Gender, Education, MaritalStatus, Usage, Fitness, Income, and Miles. The primary objective is to explore various strategies to unveil insights into the factors influencing consumer purchases at Aerofit and the types of products preferred by different demographics.

Employing statistical probabilities, visualizations, and other analytical methods, I've aimed to extract meaningful insights from this dataset.
